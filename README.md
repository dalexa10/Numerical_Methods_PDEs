# Numerical_Methods_PDEs
Repo to host examples of numerical methods to solve PDEs 
The examples are based on the repository created by Professor Luke Olson for his Lectures on Numerical Methods for PDEs at UIUC. More info [here](https://github.com/lukeolson/cs555-demos)

If you are taking the curse, use this repo as reference only. Take a look to [ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY AND PROCEDURE] (https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-402/) before copying the codes
